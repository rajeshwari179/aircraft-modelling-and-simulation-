# CSE-6730-Project-Group-1-Aircraft-Modelling-and-Simulation
Code repo for Group 1's CSE 6730 project

The aim is to create a simulation of a variable-geometry aircraft for climb, cruise & descent. This project relies on 2 tools:

1. [Dymos](https://openmdao.github.io/dymos/) and [OpenMDAO](https://openmdao.org/) - NASA tools for variable control optimization. An example for a climb simulation for a fixed wing aircraft is provided [here](https://openmdao.github.io/dymos/examples/min_time_climb/min_time_climb.html).
2. [OpenVSP](https://openvsp.org/) - NASA tool for aircraft modelling.
